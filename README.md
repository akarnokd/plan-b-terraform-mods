# plan-b-terraform-mods
Unity/BepInEx mods for the game **Plan B Terraform** [@ Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894430/Plan_B_Terraform/)

## Version <a href='https://github.com/akarnokd/plan-b-terraform-mods/releases'><img src='https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/akarnokd/plan-b-terraform-mods' alt='Latest GitHub Release Version'/></a>

[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/akarnokd/plan-b-terraform-mods/total.svg)](https://github.com/akarnokd/plan-b-terraform-mods/releases)

## Supported version: Early Access (0.7.5-824)

:information_source: **The plan is to support the main branch of the (Early Access) game**, depending on how differences will accumulate between it and the beta branch. Afaik, the Demo will completely go away and may return later, but it is unknown how far behind it will be kept mechanics-vise.

### Notable file paths

#### Game install directory

**(for example)**

`c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Plan B Terraform\`

#### Save file location

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Gaddy Games\Plan B Terraform\{yoursteamid}\Saves`

:information_source: where `{yoursteamid}` is a bunch of numbers representing your Steam Account ID.

#### Game log location

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Gaddy Games\Plan B Terraform\Player.log`

#### BepInEx log location

**(depending on your game's install directory)**

`c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Plan B Terraform\BepInEx\LogOutput.log`

#### Plugin directory

**(depending on your game's install directory)**

`c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Plan B Terraform\BepInEx\plugins`

#### Plugin config directory

**(depending on your game's install directory)**

`c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Plan B Terraform\BepInEx\config`

## Installation

1. *[One time only]* Download the 64-bit **BepInEx 5.4.21+** from [BepInEx releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
    - Make sure you **don't download** the latest, which is the 6.x.y line.
    - Make sure you download the correct version for your operating system.
2. *[One time only]* Unpack the BepInEx zip into the game's folder
    - Example: `c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Plan B Terraform\`
3. *[One time only]* Run the game. Quit the game
    - You should now see the `BepInEx\plugins` directory in the game's directory
4. Unpack the mod zip into the `BepInEx\plugins` directory.
    - [Visit the download page](https://github.com/akarnokd/plan-b-terraform-mods/releases/latest) and **look for the `akarnokd-YYYYY.zip` files!**
    - I highly recommend keeping the directory structure of the zip intact, so, for example, it will look like `BepInEx\plugins\akarnokd - (Feat) Add City Names`
    - It makes updating or removing mods much easier.
5. If the mods don't appear to work, check the `BepInEx\OutputLog.log` for errors.
    - Also check the game's own log in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Gaddy Games\Plan B Terraform\Player.log`
6. Many mods have configuration files you can edit under `BepInEx\config`.
    - *[Once per mod]* For the config file to show up, run the game and quit in the main menu.
    - The config file will be under the `BepInEx\config` (for example, `BepInEx\config\akarnokd.planbterraformmods.feataddcitynames.cfg`). You can edit with any text editor.
    - If something stops working, delete the `cfg` file and the mod will create a default one the next time the game is run.

## Uninstallation

1. Locate the `BepInEx\plugins` directory (or files if you haven't kept the directory structure from the zip).
   - Example: `c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Plan B Terraform\BepInEx\plugins`
2. Delete the plugin's directory, including all files inside it
   - Example: `BepInEx\plugins\akarnokd - (Feat) Add City Names`
3. *[Optional]* Delete the mod's configuration from the `BepInEx\config` directory
   - Example: `BepInEx\config\akarnokd.planbterraformmods.feataddcitynames.cfg`

Translation kindly provided by **johnruby (Discord)**

為遊戲添加 **Chinese Traditional (繁體中文)** 語言選項和翻譯標籤。

翻譯由 **johnruby (Discord) 友情提供**

#### Configuration

None.

## More Cities

Generate more cities for a new game.

The game currently defaults to 3 cities per planet. This mod adds a slider to the **New Planet** screen where you can set the number of additional cities to be generated. For example, if set to *2*, the game will have 5 cities total.

#### Configuration

<details><summary><code>akarnokd.planbterraformmods.featmorecities.cfg</code></summary>

```
## How many more cities to generate for a new game
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 0
CityCountAdd = 0
```
</details>

## More Ore Fields

Adjust the ore field generation logic by changing the field frequency and size range of the ore fields in the **New Planet** dialog (or via configuration file).

The numbers can be adjusted globally and/or per ore type (this latter only via config file for now):

- `GenerationPeriodAdd` - the game generates fields proportional to the number of all hexes, thus to increase the frequency of fields, set this number to negative.
- `MinHexesAdd` - increase the minimum number of hexes per ore field.
- `MaxHexesAdd` - increase the maximum number of hexes per ore field.
- `MineralMaxAdd` - the maximum number of minerals inside each hex.

Supported ore types (see them in separate config sections):

- `sulfur`
- `iron`
- `aluminumOre`
- `fluorite`

## Disable building

Enable and disable production buildings via a on-screen button or keyboard shortcut.

Toggle enable/disable with <kbd>K</kbd> (configurable) when a building is selected or use the **factory icon button** (default bottom-left of the screen). Disabled buildings will show a red crossed out circle (:no_entry_sign:) over the buildings on the main screen.

The building state is persisted in your save.

:information_source: The save format is not changed by the mod and remains compatible with the vanilla save, meaning that removing the mod won't break it.

:information_source: Note that the location and size of the **factory icon button** is not adapting to screen resolution by itself so please use the configuration settings to adjust its position and size.

Supported buildings:

- Extractors (plain *Extractor*, *Ice Extractor*)
- Factories (plain *Factory*, *Assembly Plant*, *Greenhouse*)
- Other (*Pumping Station*)

## Depot Priority

Set priorities on depots so containers will be force-transferred towards higher priority depots.

Select a depot and see the small panel on the bottom-left of the screen. The up and down buttons can adjust the priority. You can have any priority number, only the relative numbers between depots in each other's reach matter.

When copying a depot with priority, newly built depots will copy the priority number (not holding any keys), give ever increasing number while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> or ever decreasing number with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. This should allow building long priority chains forwards or backwards.

Press <kbd>P</kbd> (configurable) to show and hide the priority numbers in the world overlay.

:warning: Depots with priority and without priority do not interact with each other. This avoid bouncing containers between them.

Use the <kbd>Middle mouse</kbd> on the panel to reset the priority.

## VSync Limit Framerate

Reduce the framerate when vsync is turned on to 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 of the system's default framerate. Set the divider in the config file.

:information_source: By default, when VSync is turned on in an Unity game, the engine will try to render everything at the system's default framerate. I.e., If you have a 60Hz monitor, then 60 FPS. If you have a 144Hz monitor, then 144FPS. Unfortunately, this can tax the system unnecessarily. In addition, trying to limit the framerate directly to a value doesn't work when VSync is on (Unity limitation). The only option to have the game run at lower framerate and also not get screen tearing is to set a "higher number" VSync mode in the engine. This means that VSync = 2 will halve the framerate, VSync = 3 will third and VSync = 4 will quarter. Higher values are not supported.
