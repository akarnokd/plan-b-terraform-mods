LOADING_TIPS_7=Several Supply Centers (and Waste Disposals) are required when your city grows larger.
LOADING_TIPS_8=It's not recommended to play at fast speed all the time. Resource depletion and damages from high water levels will be much harder to control.
LOADING_TIPS_9=Do not build your industries on the blue marks visible in enhanced view ({INPUT_enhancedView}), as those areas will probably get flooded later.
LOADING_TIPS_10=Water evaporates from the oceans, moves as clouds, and then falls back to the surface as rain, forming rivers that flow back into the oceans.

CHARACTER_earthGeneral=Earth Organisation General
DIALOG_start=Welcome to {0}! Let's start by creating new Extractors.
DIALOG_level2=Good start! Now you can build new factories.
DIALOG_level3=Our scientific team has developed a way to produce Concrete from the Sulfur regolith found here.\nYour cities will need this Concrete to grow.
DIALOG_level4=Well done. To grow further, the cities will need Oxygen. Their own generators won't be enough.
DIALOG_level5=We have just invented a stronger concrete. It will help cities to build higher buildings.
DIALOG_level6=Time to start terraforming! Our ultimate goal: make this planet suitable for life with oceans, plants and breathable air.
DIALOG_level6b=First step is to raise the temperature!\nProduce and release SF6, a very powerful greenhouse gas.
DIALOG_level7=Well done! Terraforming is in progress. Here on Earth, we invest heavily and make good progress to fight climate warming, but it's not easy.\nIf things were turning bad, a terraformed {0} would ensure the survival of humanity. It's our Plan B.
DIALOG_level7b=We hope that our work here on {0} can serve as an example of what mankind can produce, when we get serious about it.\nIn the meantime, you have now access to High Technology Parts. They will improve the quality of life in cities.
DIALOG_level8=Bigger cities produce so much waste they can't handle it without recycling. They'll soon require your help.\nYou must recycle their waste and return it to the resources flow.
DIALOG_level9=We get limited funding from Earth for our labs here, but we were able to perfect an automated train that moves resources further and faster.
DIALOG_level9b=Sorry, Earth has its own issues. Big political changes here in many countries. Nationalism is on the rise and countries are turning inwards. {0} is not a priority anymore.
DIALOG_level10=Metal recycling is not enough; bigger cities will generate Plastic Waste.
DIALOG_level10b=We have developed a new Greenhouse Gas, NF3, which uses Nitrogen that you can extract from the polar ice. Try to balance your production of SF6 and NF3 to have the most efficient impact on temperatures.
DIALOG_level11=Once water is flowing it could cause some problems. Dams and pumps will help you control it.
DIALOG_level11b=Unfortunately, it's the only development we were able to fund.\nEven budgets to combat global warming here have plummeted. "It's not like the house is on fire immediately", some say.
DIALOG_reminderTemperature=Attention! You really should raise the temperature now! We are falling behind schedule.
DIALOG_level12=This is it, with our new Carbon Nano-Tube material, we should be able to build a Space Elevator!
DIALOG_level12b=This will really help transportation of colonists, and resources. We'll use it to bring you engineered seeds to grow more food for your cities.
DIALOG_level12c=The space elevator base is ready. Now we need lot of nano-tubes to build the cable.
DIALOG_level13=Space-lift operational. We'll start bringing you seeds at once. Those seeds are engineered to produce greenhouse food very efficiently.
DIALOG_level14=We have genetically modified plant species in order to make them viable in our atmosphere, but they still need the appropriate temperature and humidity.
DIALOG_level15=Those Carbon Nano-Tubes can now be used to create a formidable Nano-Composite building material.
DIALOG_level15b=This new material your scientists created is indeed very promising. Its usages are very exciting!
DIALOG_level15c=Good day. I'm the {0} Council Elder. Be careful of Earth directives. Regional tensions on Earth are getting worse, and we fear they will try to involve us somehow.
DIALOG_level16=Greetings. Please be advised that the Organization is now taking charge of maintaining global peace on Earth. Your Nano Composite will be a great contribution to this noble cause. Please bring some to the Space Elevator.
DIALOG_level16b=This is worse than we thought. The Space Elevator was not meant to provide resources for war!
DIALOG_reminderTrees=Attention! You really should plant more trees now! The oxygen level is not increasing fast enough.
DIALOG_level17=War rages on Earth. We need more resources. Bring more Nano Composite, so we can continue to give you Seeds.
DIALOG_level17b=It's terrible how they extort us. Our scientists could develop these seeds themselves, but Earth controls our labs...
DIALOG_level18=We need as many resources as possible. It's your only priority now. Seed supply is cut off until further notice.
DIALOG_level18b=They have gone too far. Just do as they say; we'll take care of it from here.
DIALOG_level19=Earth, we are no longer supporting your war. We declare our independence now! Take this as proof of our determination.
DIALOG_level19bis=We have taken control of the planet and, consequentially, we can finally use technology blocked by Earth. Watch out for the falling space elevator.
DIALOG_level20=As you can imagine, Earth has not accepted our independence, but sooner or later they will have to!
DIALOG_level20bis=On another subject: Once oceans are large enough, you'll need these Container Ships to easily transport tons of containers. If some land is blocking your path, use dynamite to blast your way through!
DIALOG_level21=Surrender now, terrorists! And give us access to your resources right now.
DIALOG_level21bis=Earth keeps sending us threats but they have major issues on their own. The global warming is catching up with them. The Antarctic polar shelf has slid towards the ocean causing sea levels to rise dozens of meters. Entire regions are submerged and we can see massive population movements.
DIALOG_level21ter=I know you are busy with geopolitical problems, but we need to keep our cities fed. Once we have enough oxygen in the atmosphere, we can grow outdoor farms!
DIALOG_level22=More plants species have been adapted to our planet atmosphere.
DIALOG_level23=Surrender! Last warning, or we will start to bomb out your cities!
DIALOG_level23bis=Earth has issued us with an ultimatum, but we are pretty sure they will not act. Still, we have developed a protection shield that should make us safe.
DIALOG_noShield_1stBomb=Alert! Missile detected in our atmosphere! They did it…
DIALOG_noShield_1stBomb_bis=It's horrifying. We cannot wait. Please build those defense field emitters!
DIALOG_noShield_otherBomb=Another incoming missile! Please, build those field emitters as fast as possible!
DIALOG_noShield_safe=We are safe now! From the communications we could intercept, nations on Earth are giving up on punishing us. They seem to go back to their conflicts, and this time, I fear for the worst.
DIALOG_noShield_safe_bis=You can go back to growing the cities. This time, our final objective of reaching one million global population is attainable.
DIALOG_shield_bomb=Alert! Missile detected in our atmosphere! Raise the Shields!
DIALOG_shield_bomb_bis=The shield did work perfectly! We are safe. Earth will probably move back to its own conflicts, unfortunately for them.
DIALOG_earthBad=Terrible news from Earth. Regional tensions and climate change consequences have finally triggered a war on global scale, between the most powerful nations.
DIALOG_earthReallyBad=All Earth communications have suddenly stopped. We are detecting very high levels of radiation in its atmosphere. Not much else to do now other than concentrate on the future of our own planet.
DIALOG_level26a=All readings are optimal. The atmosphere is stable, vegetation is flourishing, and animals roam freely. Life is thriving again.
DIALOG_level26=At last… We have reached one million inhabitants. Humanity has found a new home. Our future is secure.
DIALOG_oxygen=Great news! We've reached a key oxygen level. Biologists have waited decades for this: animals will now start to be released into the wild.\nCities will also begin to require less oxygen.
